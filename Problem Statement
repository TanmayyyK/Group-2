Airline Managment System

People have to get to from one place to another and for short distances cars or public transport does the job but when there is a need to travle between states and countries in a short period of time, it becomes a hassle and traveling by airlines becomes more convinent. However airlines can't be run the same way cars are run where you can have your own plane that you fly whenever you want. Instead flights have to be scheduled and those using the services need to be able to schedule or book their seats in their desired flights in order to use the airline service. This introduces the need to create an airline management system that would handle booking of an airline for those who want to use the airline services. It also involves the handling of management of available airlines and storing the information of the flight schedules such as departure and arrival time, location, terminal etc for the customers who want to use the said services.
